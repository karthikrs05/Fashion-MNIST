# Fashion MNIST Neural Network Model

This project demonstrates how to use the Fashion MNIST dataset to build and train a neural network model for image classification. The dataset consists of images of 10 different categories of fashion items. The project uses Python, TensorFlow, and scikit-learn libraries to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.


## Dataset
The Fashion MNIST dataset is composed of 70,000 grayscale images, each 28x28 pixels, representing 10 different categories of fashion items. The dataset is divided into:

Training set: 60,000 images
Test set: 10,000 images


#### Classes

The dataset includes the following classes:

- T-shirt/top
- Trouser
- Pullover
- Dress
- Coat
- Sandal
- Shirt
- Sneaker
- Bag
- Ankle boot


## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- NumPy
- Pandas
